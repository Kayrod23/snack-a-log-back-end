Back-end feature requirements
To complete the back-end application, you will need to build a RESTful server that performs CRUD actions on a single resource.

Your server should incorporate at least one table that includes:
A primary key

At least 7 total fields

At least 4 different data types are used among those fields

Your table should have at least two constraints, which can include DEFAULT values.

A route exists to create new resources.

A route exists to read all resources.

A route exists to read a single resource.

A route exists to update a single resource.

A route exists to delete a single resource.

An appropriate "Not Found" response is given when a route is requested that does not match the created routes.
